This was our second project in the course HTML & CSS.

Our job was to read a description from a "customer" and look at that design and then 
build that website with what we have learnt.

To build this website I used HTML and SCSS. It is mostly normal CSS in that file 
because we are currently in the process of learning SCSS.
